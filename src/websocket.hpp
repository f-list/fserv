// These functions have side effects!
// The receive function for these classes DOES modify the input buffer!
// The send function DOES NOT modify the input buffer.
// This is an implementation detail. The input buffering is known to be simple.
// The output buffering is far more complex, involving splitting and other things,
// and thus is beyond the scope of these functions. Input buffering is simple to implement here,
// and saves passing around a size variable to then advance the input buffer only if needed.
